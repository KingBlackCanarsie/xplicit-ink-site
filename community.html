    <h1>The Xplicit Ink Community</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Every channel in Xplicit Ink is 18+ and built around consent, respect, and clear boundaries. Here’s how the space is laid out.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Text Channels</h2>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🛡️｜Access</span> – The starting point. This is where new members follow instructions, confirm they’re adults, and unlock the rest of the server.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🛋️｜Lobby</span> – The first stop once you’re in. A softer, general hangout where people can say hi, warm up, and get a feel for the vibe.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">💬｜Chatroom</span> – The main free‑flow space. This is where people talk, flirt, joke around, roleplay lightly, and just exist together. It’s loud, messy, and alive by design.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🤝｜Intros</span> – Long‑form introductions. Members share who they are, what they’re into socially, and what they’re looking for in the community so connections don’t feel random.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">💞｜Kinks</span> – A place to talk about preferences, interests, and compatibility in a mature way. Members often share results from tools like the BDSM test to find people whose styles match theirs. Conversation here is still expected to follow consent and respect at all times.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🚨｜Report</span> – A direct line to staff. Members can open a private ticket if something feels off, a boundary is crossed, or they need help handling a situation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Roleplay & Creative Spaces</h2>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🧙‍♂️｜Rp_Only</span> – Strictly in‑character roleplay. No out‑of‑character chatter here. If you’re typing, you’re playing a role.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🎓｜Roleplay_101</span> – A learning and practice room for people who want to improve their roleplay skills. Members can experiment, ask questions, and get feedback in a low‑pressure environment.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🎨｜Characters</span> – A gallery of character bios. Members post their original characters so others can quickly understand who they’re playing without re‑explaining every time.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🗺｜Adventurous</span> – A themed roleplay space focused on high‑energy, “out in the world” scenarios—parks, cars, beaches, and other risky or thrilling settings, all in text form.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🤰｜Breeding_Ground</span> – A themed roleplay room centered around specific fantasies and dynamics. Like all channels, it still follows the same rules of consent, respect, and no real‑life pressure.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">👑｜Domination</span> – A room built around power dynamics, dominance, and submission in roleplay and conversation. The tone is set by a pinned scenario that frames the space as intense but still grounded in mutual respect and clear boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Voice & Live Spaces</h2>
        <p><span class="channel-name">🗣️｜Mic Chat</span> – The main voice hangout. Casual conversation, background noise, and people just existing together while they do their own thing.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">📺｜Streams</span> – Screensharing and watch parties. Members host movies, shows, games, or shared experiences so people can react together in real time.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">💦｜X‑Stream</span> – An adults‑only live space for more intense, mature‑themed voice and stream sessions. Entry here assumes you understand and respect the server’s rules around consent and behavior.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">NEWEST MOVIES</span> – A long‑running movie room where members can drop in, watch together, and chat. Think of it as a virtual theater that never really closes.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">EXTREME 18+</span> – A high‑intensity adult voice room with a strong, established culture. This is not a casual drop‑in space; members are expected to understand the tone and respect everyone present.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Tickets & Support</h2>
        <p><span class="channel-name">Prvt Tickets (Waiting for staff)</span> – Private channels automatically created when a member opens a ticket. These are visible only to staff and the member until a staff response is given.</p>
        <p><span class="channel-name">Prvt Tickets (Waiting for user)</span> – Tickets where staff have responded and are waiting on the member to reply or confirm the issue is resolved.</p>
        <p>Tickets are used for conflict, boundary issues, safety concerns, or anything that needs a private, documented conversation with staff.</p>

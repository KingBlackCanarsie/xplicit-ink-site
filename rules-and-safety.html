    <h1>Rules & Safety</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Xplicit Ink is intense by design—but it only works if everyone understands the rules and respects the people around them.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">18+ only.</span> No minors, no exceptions. If staff suspect someone is underage, they will be removed.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Consent is mandatory.</span> No pressuring, no guilt‑tripping, no ignoring boundaries. “No” and “not interested” are complete answers.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Respect the person, not just the vibe.</span> Behind every username is a real human being. Treat them like one.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Privacy matters.</span> Do not share someone else’s content, voice, or screenshots outside the server without their clear permission.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">No harassment or targeting.</span> Personal attacks, stalking, doxxing, or ongoing harassment will result in removal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Behavior Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Read channel descriptions before posting. Each space has a purpose; respect it.</li>
        <li>Keep out‑of‑character drama out of roleplay spaces. If there’s an issue, move it to tickets or staff.</li>
        <li>If someone sets a boundary, accept it. Do not argue, negotiate, or try to wear them down.</li>
        <li>Staff decisions are final in the moment. If you disagree, you can open a ticket and discuss it calmly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roleplay & Intense Spaces</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Roleplay is fiction. It does not give anyone permission to cross your boundaries in DMs or real life.</li>
        <li>Check in with people you’re playing with. If something feels off, pause and talk.</li>
        <li>Do not drag people into scenes they didn’t agree to, even as a “joke.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reporting & Tickets</h2>
    <p>If something feels wrong, you’re uncomfortable, or you’re not sure how to handle a situation, you can use the <span class="highlight">🚨｜Report</span> channel to open a private ticket.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tickets are only visible to you and staff.</li>
        <li>Explain what happened as clearly as you can. Screenshots help, but are not required.</li>
        <li>Staff will respond as soon as they can. While you wait, you can mute or block the person involved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Word</h2>
    <p>Xplicit Ink is meant to be intense, fun, and immersive—but never at the cost of someone’s safety or comfort. If you’re here, you’re agreeing to act like an adult, own your behavior, and respect the people you interact with.</p>
